This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
I have done EDA which includes descriptive statistics. 
Then I have used median values of the respective outcomes to fill the missing values in all the columns. The primary reason behind using the median value is the presence of outliers.
I have build the logistic regression model by scalling the model using Power Transformer method and tuned the hyper-parameters and finally used bagging classifier to get the best model.
